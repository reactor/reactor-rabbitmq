== Motivation

[[motivation-functional]]
=== Functional interface for RabbitMQ

Reactor RabbitMQ is a functional Java API for RabbitMQ.
For applications that are written in functional style,
this API enables RabbitMQ interactions to be integrated
easily without requiring non-functional produce or consume APIs to be
incorporated into the application logic.


[[back-pressure]]
=== Non-blocking Back-pressure

The Reactor RabbitMQ API benefits from non-blocking back-pressure
provided by Reactor. For example, in a pipeline, where
messages received from an external source (e.g. an HTTP proxy) are published
to RabbitMQ, back-pressure can be applied easily to the
whole pipeline, limiting the number of messages in-flight and controlling memory usage.
Messages flow through the pipeline as they are available,
with Reactor taking care of limiting the flow rate to avoid overflow,
keeping application logic simple.

[[end-to-end-reactive]]
=== End-to-end Reactive Pipeline

The value proposition for Reactor RabbitMQ is the efficient utilization of resources
in applications with multiple external interactions where RabbitMQ is one of the
external systems. End-to-end reactive pipelines benefit from
non-blocking back-pressure and efficient use of threads, enabling a
large number of concurrent requests to be processed efficiently.
The optimizations provided by Project Reactor enable development of reactive applications
with very low overheads and predictable capacity planning to deliver low-latency,
high-throughput pipelines.

[[comparison]]
=== Comparisons with other RabbitMQ Java libraries

Reactor RabbitMQ is not intended to replace any of the existing Java libraries.
Instead, it is aimed at providing an alternative API for reactive event-driven applications.

==== RabbitMQ Java Client

For non-reactive applications, https://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html[RabbitMQ Java Client]
provides the most complete API to manage resources, publish messages to and
consume messages from RabbitMQ. Note Reactor RabbitMQ is based on RabbitMQ Java Client.

Applications using RabbitMQ as a message bus using this API may consider
switching to Reactor RabbitMQ if the application is implemented in a functional style.

==== Spring AMQP

https://projects.spring.io/spring-amqp/[Spring AMQP] applies core
https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/[Spring Framework]
concepts to the development of AMQP-based messaging solutions.
It provides a "template" as a high-level abstraction for sending and receiving messages.
It also provides support for Message-driven POJOs with a "listener container".
These libraries facilitate management of AMQP resources while promoting the use of
dependency injection and declarative configuration. Spring AMQP is based on
RabbitMQ Java Client.
