=== RabbitMQ

With more than 35,000 production deployments world-wide
at small startups and large enterprises, https://rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ] is the most popular
open source message broker.

RabbitMQ is lightweight and easy to deploy on premises and in the cloud.
It supports multiple messaging protocols. RabbitMQ can be deployed in
distributed and federated configurations to meet high-scale, high-availability requirements.

=== Project Reactor

https://projectreactor.io[Reactor] is a highly optimized reactive library for
building efficient, non-blocking applications on the JVM based on the
https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm[Reactive Streams Specification].
Reactor based applications can sustain very high throughput message rates
and operate with a very low memory footprint,
making it suitable for building efficient event-driven applications using
the microservices architecture.

Reactor implements two publishers
https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html[Flux<T>] and
https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Mono.html[Mono<T>],
both of which support non-blocking back-pressure.
This enables exchange of data between threads with well-defined memory usage,
avoiding unnecessary intermediate buffering or blocking.

=== Reactive API for RabbitMQ

link:../api/index.html[Reactor RabbitMQ] is a reactive API for RabbitMQ
based on Reactor and https://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html[RabbitMQ Java Client].
Reactor RabbitMQ API enables messages to be published to
RabbitMQ and consumed from RabbitMQ using functional APIs
with non-blocking back-pressure and very low overheads.
This enables applications using Reactor to use RabbitMQ as a message bus or
streaming platform and integrate with other systems to provide an end-to-end
reactive pipeline.
