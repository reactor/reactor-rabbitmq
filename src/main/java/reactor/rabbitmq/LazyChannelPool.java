/**
 * Default implementation of {@link ChannelPool}.
 * <p>
 * This channel pool is lazy initialized. It might even not reach its maximum size
 * {@link ChannelPoolOptions#getMaxCacheSize()} in low-concurrency environments.
 * It always tries to obtain a channel from the pool. However, in case of high-concurrency environments,
 * number of channels might exceed channel pool maximum size.
 * <p>
 * Channels are added to the pool after their use {@link ChannelPool#getChannelCloseHandler()}
 * and obtained from the pool when channel is requested {@link ChannelPool#getChannelMono()}.
 * <p>
 * If the pool is empty, a new channel is created.
 * If a channel is no longer needed and the channel pool is full, then the channel is being closed.
 * If a channel is no longer needed and the channel pool has not reached its
 * capacity, then the channel is added to the pool.
 * <p>
 * It uses {@link BlockingQueue} internally in a non-blocking way.
 *
 * @since 1.1.0
