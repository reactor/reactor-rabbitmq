This document is the API specification for the Reactor RabbitMQ library.
<hr/>
<div id="overviewBody">
    <p>
        Reactor RabbitMQ is a reactive API for <a href="https://rabbitmq.com/">Apache Kafka</a> based on
        <a href="https://projectreactor.io">Project Reactor</a>. Reactor RabbitMQ API enables messages to be
        published to RabbitMQ exchanges and consumed from RabbitMQ queues using functional APIs with non-blocking back-pressure
        and very low overheads. This enables applications using Reactor to use RabbitMQ as a message bus or
        streaming platform and integrate with other systems to provide an end-to-end reactive pipeline.
    </p>
    <h3><a href="reactor/rabbitmq/Sender.html">Sender</a></h3>

    sender.send(Flux.range(0, 10).map(i -> new OutboundMessage(exchange, routingKey, ("Message_" + i).getBytes()));
          .subscribe();
